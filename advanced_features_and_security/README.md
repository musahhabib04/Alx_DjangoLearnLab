- **HSTS (31536000s)** â†’ Browsers always connect via HTTPS for one year
- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True** â†’ Session cookies only sent over HTTPS
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True** â†’ CSRF cookies only sent over HTTPS
- **X_FRAME_OPTIONS = DENY** â†’ Prevents clickjacking
- **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True** â†’ Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True** â†’ Enables browser XSS protection

### Deployment
- Configured web server (e.g., Nginx) with SSL/TLS certificates
- HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS
- Certificates managed via Let's Encrypt
