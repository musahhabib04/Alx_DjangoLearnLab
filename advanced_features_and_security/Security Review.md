- Deployment with SSL/TLS certificates

### Benefits
- Protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
- Prevents session hijacking over HTTP
- Mitigates clickjacking and XSS risks

### Next Steps
- Regularly update SSL certificates
- Enable monitoring tools for HTTPS and headers
- Run penetration tests before production deployment
